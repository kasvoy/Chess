# Chess
Chess engine implementation in C

This is a work in progress, so far this is a 2 player chess game, where both players can take turns by typing moves in standard notation (e.g. e4, Bc5, etc.).

Next steps in this program include finishing implementing all chess rules and introducing a basic form of AI that chooses moves based on material gain etc.
